Redux Toolkit Workflow: Step-by-Step Guide
1.	Define the Feature Slice

Each feature (state) in your app should have its own slice. This slice:

-	Defines the initial state
-	Contains reducers (business logic)
-	Exports actions and reducer

Example: Creating a counterSlice.js 

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; },
    decrement: (state) => { state.count -= 1; }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions; // Export actions
export default counterSlice.reducer; // Export reducer


2.	Configure the Redux Store

The store holds all slices in a structured way. Each key in the store represents a different feature.

Example: Setting up store.js

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './features/counterSlice';
import videoReducer from './features/videoSlice'; // Example: Another slice

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer, // "counter" state
    video: videoReducer      // "video" state
  }
});

export default store;






3.	Provide the store to the React App

To connect Redux to React, wrap your app with Provider, so all components can access the store.

Example: Adding Provider in index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
















4.	Select State from the Redux Store using useSelector() 

Components use the useSelector() hook to access specific slices of state from Redux.

Example: Accessing the Counter State

import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const CounterDisplay = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);

  return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>;
};






















5.	Dispatch Actions using useDispatch() 

Actions trigger state changes in Redux. Use the useDispatch() hook to send actions to Redux. 

Example: Dispatching Actions to Change State

import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from '../features/counterSlice';

const CounterControls = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};















6.	Redux Forwards the Action to the Respective Reducer

-	When dispatch(increment()) is called, Redux forwards the action to the counterSlice reducer.

-	The reducer checks the action.type and updates the state accordingly. 

7.	The Reducer Updates the State

The reducer modifies the state based on the action type. 

Example: If increment() is dispatched

reducers: {
  increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; }
}

-	The state updates from { count: 0 } -> { count: 1 }.

-	This happens immutably using Immer.js (built into Redux Toolkit).

8.	Redux Updates the Store

Once the reducer modifies the state, Redux updates the store with the new state values. 

9.	React Automatically Re-Renders Components

-	Since, the store is updated, React detects the state change and re-renders only the components using the modified state. 

-	This ensures performance without unnecessary re-renders. 



10.	The Updated State Reflects the UI

After re-rendering, the latest state values are displayed in the UI.

Example: Updated Counter Display

const CounterDisplay = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);

  return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>; // Updated count will be shown here
};
























Final Summary of the Redux Toolkit Workflow:
-	Create a Slice for each feature (state).
-	Define Reducers (Business Logic) inside the slice.
-	Export Actions & Reducers from the slice. 
-	Configure the Store by adding all feature slices. 
-	Provide the Store to the App by using the <Provider />. 
-	Use the useSelector() hook Read State inside the components.
-	Use the useDispatch() hook to Send Actions to Redux.
-	Reducer Modifies the State based on the action type.
-	Redux updates the Store with new state values.
-	React Detects the State Change and re-renders the components efficiently.
